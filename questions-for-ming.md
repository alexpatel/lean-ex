# Questions for Ming

- Dependent types - other than Pi and Sigma, what kinds of dependent types are
there?
- Can I do this all with OOP in Java - like C-H correspondence, proofs as types etc.?
- Can you do the kinds of things that are demonstrated in Lean in any functional
programming language?
- Can you verify that a program doesn't divide by 0 using type systems?
- What capabilities features can't be captured with this?
- What other formal methods than type systesm could be useful for barrelfish?
- I don't understand implicit arguments, why do {p : Prop} and p : Prop allow
for such different syntaxes?
- I kind of understand that \rightarrow and "implies" are equivalent by C-H
correspondence, but can you just explain this in your own words for this
example, specifically - like implies is a function of type Prop -> Prop and how
does instantiation come into play here?
