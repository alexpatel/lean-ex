Declare a constant matrix so that matrix m n could represent the
type of m by n matrices. Declare some constants to represent functions on
this type, such as matrix addition and multiplication, and (using vec )
multiplication of a matrix by a vector. Once again, declare some variables
and check some expressions involving the constants that you have declared.
