# LEAN Prover examples

These are exercises for learning the [LEAN](https://leanprover.github.io/) programming language originating from:
- [Logic and Proof](https://leanprover.github.io/logic_and_proof/logic_and_proof.pdf)
- [Programming in Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/programming_in_lean/programming_in_lean.pdf)
- [Theorem Proving in Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/theorem_proving_in_lean.pdf)

# hacking notes

- Use `brew install lean` to get LEAN on MacOS, it puts the executable in at `/usr/local/bin/lean`.
- You need to use an IDE with support. If you don't already know emacs, LEAN + VS Code >>>>> LEAN + Emacs.
- `lean` executable doesn't print help string if you give it any arguments.
